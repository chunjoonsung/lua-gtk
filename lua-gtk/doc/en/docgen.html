This section explains how the documentation you are now reading is generated.
A Lua script named <code>gen-html.lua</code> does the transformation of the
input files into complete HTML pages, including header, title, menu and the
actual content.

<p>
Type <tt>make doc</tt> in the source directory to output the documentation
in the subdirectory <tt>build/doc</tt>.  This also builds detailed
documentation directly from the source.
