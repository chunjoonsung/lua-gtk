<h3>Why look at hash functions?</h3>

<p>

In a previous job, I was asked to look at hashing functions and got into a
dispute with my boss about how such functions should be designed.  I had 
advocated the used of LFSRs or CRCs that would be customized to the size of
the table, as discussed in "Numerical Recipes".  My boss advocated simply 
performing a modulo by prime operation and cited Knuth's 30 years old "the 
Art of Computer Programming".  I showed him examples where modulo by prime
had extremely bad collisions, but this did not seem to sway him at all.  It
seems Knuth's rewrites have come too late.

<p>

A coworker "settled" the dispute by discovering <a 
href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html" target="bjhash">Bob 
Jenkin's hash function</a>. This outperformed both of our suggestions while 
being based on better analysis regarding collisions.  I had bookmarked the 
webpage and occassionally referred to it in future projects, and noticed the 
two additions of the "One at a time Hash" and <a 
href="http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/" target="fnvhash">"FNV 
hash"</a> as updates to the page over time.  The thing about the Bob Jenkin's 
function is that the code is messy, and uses a large number of mystery 
constants whose construction I did not understand.  Both the "One at a time 
Hash" and "FNV Hash" are extremely elegant with very few magic constants.

<p>

Bob Jenkins himself indicated that FNV outperformed his own function, so at 
first I simply took his word for it, and started using the FNV hash blindly on
all occassions.  After that, I had finally had the occassion to measure the
real performance inside of a project.  After a number of miscalculations and
mismeasurements, I decided that I needed to study the problem for real.

<h3>Analyzing existing hash functions</h3>

<p>

The first thing I noticed was that on my system (an Athlon XP) the Bob 
Jenkins function outperformed basically everything else (including the FNV 
function) by a large margin.  How do we resolve this contradiction with Bob 
Jenkins' claim?  Simple -- he was measuring on a "Pentium".  Intel's latest
Pentium IV is known to have very slow shifters which slows down <em>every</em>
hash function <em>except</em> the FNV function which uses a multiply instead.
The Opteron/Athlon 64 architecture has a vastly improved integer multiplier 
(unchallenged by any other architecture, save perhaps the Itanium) which 
suggests that the FNV hash should do well on that system as well.

<p>

But at a more fundamental level I wanted to understand what the real 
performance limiters were for these functions to see if a recoding of them 
might help (I performed a similar exercise for some reference MD5 code and got
a drammatic performance boost, so I was optimistic.)  The Bob Jenkins' code is
too convoluted and it seemed that the compiler or out-of-order CPU 
architectures could easily find the parallelism that was there (and there is
some to be had.)  

<p>

But the CRCs and One at a time Hash are completely instruction after 
instruction dependent.  So I split the input data into odd and even bytes and
calculated two parallel CRCs and One at a time Hashes then at the end 
combined one into the other as if it were more data.  This markedly improved 
the performance of these functions, but not quite up to the point of 
outperforming the Bob Jenkins hash.  So I did not completely pursue the task 
of proving the suitability of these modified functions.

<p>

If I was going to try to outperform Bob Jenkins' function, I would have to take
a step back and understand the functional nature of the bottleneck in these 
functions.  The functions other than Bob Jenkins' basically operated on the 
idea of consuming one 8-bit byte at a time of input data and mixing each in 
some <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Injection.html" 
target="mathworld">injective</a> way into some 32-bit accumulator which, 
after possible post processing, is simply output.  One can see the motivation
of this idea -- each input byte can be mixed twice with a large degree of 
freedom in the 32 bit accumulator without self overlapping.  Thus in 
successive steps its only really required to sort of "spread out" consecutive 
sequences of at most 8 bits in such a way that previous bytes don't obviously 
cancell out.

<p>

This is explicitely seen in the "One at a Time hash" function.  In fact, 
for each byte only a few very simple operations are performed -- a final 
short sequence of operations is required at the end.  These operations at the
end are required to make sure the bits in the last few bytes fully "avalanche"
to all the output bytes.  Avalanching is the property between an input and 
output bit where the output bit will flip with a probability p ("close" to 
0.5) if the input bit is flipped relative to any random input data.  A good
hash function requires avalanching from all input bits to all the output bits.
(Incidentally, Bob Jenkins overly chastizes CRCs for their lack of 
avalanching -- CRCs are not supposed to be truncated to fewer bits as other 
more general hash functions are; you are supposed to construct a custom CRC
for each number of bits you require.)

<h3>Creating a new hash function</h3>

<p>

Using the One at a Time hash function as a model, the next obvious question to
ask is "why not try to use fewer operations between data fragments"?  The idea
would be to rely more heavily on fixups at the end to produce the final 
avalanching which adds a constant time overhead in hopes of reducing the 
linear overhead.  I.e., the mixing function would in fact operate much more
slowly relative to the stream of input bytes, but this would not matter to the
bulk of the early bytes because they would eventually reach a maximal point of
avalanching anyway.

<p>

So my thought was to use fewer instructions per input fragment and to 
increase the size of the input fragment from 8 bits to 16 bits.  On the x86 
this latter idea has a particularly high impact on performance since these
architectures have hardware support for unaligned 16 bit word accesses.  Using
Bob Jenkin's definition of avalanching, I chose an inner loop instruction 
sequence that I thought might work by interleaving two 16 bit words, then 
wrote a program to search for parameters which gave the greatest amount of 
avalanching before requiring a fix up for the end.  I then added instructions
that would be equivalent of unrolling the inner loop corresponding to padding 
the input with a fixed number zeros, then scanned for the set of parameters
which could complete the avalanching for all the real input bits.

<p>

I was shocked to find that there were no significant impediments to this
exercise, and I easily found a hash function with all these properties after a 
few hours or work.  I then subjected all realistic sub-bit patterns of the 
hash output to a simple statistical test and verified that it had a 
distribution equivalent to a uniformly random map.

<p>

The moment of truth came with the performance test -- but given the 
architecture, it was a forgone conclusion.  My hash function performs around 
66% faster than Bob Jenkin's functions tested with various compilers.

<p>

Below is the code:

MSVC seems to have a hard time optimizing the two faster hash functions, and
surprisingly the open source gcc is able to turn in the outright fastest
result.  Well done!

<p>

For the hash function to have the correct properties, it is assumed that 
CHAR_BIT is 8 and computations use 2s complement arithmetic.

<p>

I was initially worried that using a portable way of accessing 16 bits at a 
time would erode the performance significantly.  Although none of the x86 
compilers correctly reduced the portable version to the direct version 
(something worth complaining about), subsequent testing showed that this did 
not lead to the drastic performance drop that I thought it would (only about 
20%). This leads me to believe that even on RISC architectures that this 
function should perform very well versus the Bob Jenkins, or other hashes.

<p>

<b>Update(1):</b> David C. wrote: <em>I tested your hash function against 
all of the popular ones, including Bob Burtles. It turns out it was not only 
the quickest but had the best distribution (I created histograms of the chain 
lengths). The architecture I work on is IBM Z/OS (S/390 mainframes). Well 
done mate, will be using your code from now on!</em>  Ok, not exactly RISC, 
but at least this demonstrates that this function is good beyond the x86 
architecture.

<p>

<b>Update(2):</b> I have recently gained access to a Power4 based Linux 
machine, as can be seen in the updated performance table above.  
(Interestingly, even normalizing for clock rate differences, the Athlon XP is 
35-40% faster than the Power4 architecture).  I did not see any appreciable 
performance difference between gcc and the native cc compiler, so I just 
reported the results from gcc.  The performance ratio between SuperFastHash 
and Bob Jenkins is only slightly less impressive, so the main point about its 
advantage still holds.

<p>

<b>Update(3):</b> Feedback from Tim Rentsch suggested that to be fair,
Bob Jenkin's hash should leverage the x86's unaligned access feature as
well (this helps it even more than for my function because it accesses 32 
bits at once.)  I have also rescheduled the operations of SuperFastHash to 
maximally leverage the pipelines of modern CPUs.  I have made the code more 
uniform in its treatment of integers, so besides being portable from a 
compilation point of view, it is now more portable from a semantic point of 
view.  And finally I have added results from an alpha numeric hash that has 
been discussed on USENET.

<h3>Future work to be considered</h3>

The newest generation of CPUs are capable of 64 bit computation and certainly
in a few years we can expect that there will be widespread development with 
tool availability for 64 bit software.  So should this idea work by reading 
32 bits at a time within a 64 bit accumulator?  Probably, and we could expect
the result to have roughly twice the asymptotic performance.

<p>

<s>There's also the question of the inline dependencies.  There are 6 
instruction dependencies in the inner loop, so its quite possible that the
odd and even word splits and recombination might lead to a substantial 
performance boost.</s> (Rescheduling the operations actually saturates even
the 3-pipeline Athlon, so unrolling is not necessary.)

<p>

<b>Update(1):</b> There have been some requests for an incremental version
of SuperFastHash.  This is straightforward enough to do, by accepting the
"hash" value as a parameter, and initializing it with some non-zero constant 
(since the point is to assume that the length is not available until all the 
data is read).  The only sticking issue, is <em>which</em> constant to choose.

<p>

<b>Update(2):</b> Tim Rentsch has noticed that the bit avalanching probability
of SuperFastHash deviates from 50% more than Bob Jenkin's hash -- this is 
true, in fact it is between 5/12 and 7/12 (by design), while Bob Jenkin's 
hash appears to be far closer to 50%.  There are some easy hacks limited to
adding to the avalanche code at the end (for example, adding hash += (hash << 16) | 
(hash >> 16) to the end) to make all the bits of my hash function avalanche 
with a probability between .485 and .515, however its probably best that I 
revisit this to see how to achieve this with the least additional impact.
