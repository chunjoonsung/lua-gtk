<p>
The core module <tt>gnome</tt> defines a few variables, which are not directly
useful to the user.  Their function is described here.  All of them can, but
must not be modified, at the risk of malfunctioning.
</p>

<dl>

 <dt>api</dt>
  <dd>A userdata with version information and a jump table.  It is used by
    modules to access functionality of the core module.</dd>

 <dt>emptryattr</dt>
  <dd>All Lua objects (<tt>struct object</tt>) proxying a C object have an
   environment to store arbitrary key/value pairs.  To avoid having an empty
   table for each such object, they all initially are assigned the same,
   empty table.  The first assignment then creates a private table. This shared
   table is stored here.</dd>

 <dt>fundamental_map</dt>
  <dd>For each fundamental type supported by the core library, like
  <tt>int</tt>, <tt>struct</tt> etc., one entry is created with the key=hash
  value, data=index into <tt>ffi_type_map</tt>, defined in the build directory
  <tt>gnome/fundamentals.c</tt>.  This table is filled by the function
  <tt>src/gnome/data.c:lg_create_fundamental_map</tt> when the core module
  is loaded, and isn't modified afterwards.</dd>

 <dt>typemap</dt>
  <dd>Each supported datatype has one entry in this table.  Key is the
   hash value of the type name, while the data is a <tt>typespec_t</tt>, a
   32 bit value described in <tt>include/common.h</tt> consisting of
   a module index and a type index, and a flag value.  This table is initially
   empty, with more entries being added when a module is loaded.</dd>

 <dt>aliases</dt>
  <dd>Each Lua proxy object has at least one entry here, but can have multiple.
  Key is an index (see the objects table), value is the proxy object.  If an
  object is accessed as different types (typecasting, e.g. GtkEvent and
  GdkEventKey), more than one proxy object may be needed.</dd>

 <dt>metatables</dt>
  <dd>One entry per metatable for objects; all objects of the same type share
  the same metatable.</dd>

 <dt>NIL</dt>
  <dd>A lightuserdata pointing to NULL; can be used in certain situations
  instead of nil, which is ignored as last elements of tables etc.</dd>

 <dt>objects</dt>
  <dd>Maps a library object's address (via lightuserdata) to an index
  in the <tt>aliases</tt> table.</dd>
