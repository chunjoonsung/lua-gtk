<p>
A data type is defined by instances of <tt>union type_info</tt>, which is
declared in <tt>include/common.h</tt> and has the following fields (total size
is 8 bytes):
</p>

<dl>
 <dt>genus</dt><dd>The only field that is always available; it specifies what
   type the type has, and as that sounds somewhat convoluted, I chose the
   name "genus" for this field.  Following values are possible:
   <ul>
    <li>GENUS_NON_NATIVE (0) - this entry refers to a type defined in another
      module.</li>
    <li>GENUS_STRUCTURE (1) - a composite type, i.e. struct or union. </li>
    <li>GENUS_FUNCTION (2) - a function pointer; a location of the function's
      signature is provided.</li>
    <li>GENUS_FUNDAMENTAL (3) - a fundamental type (other than function) which
      is handled directly by ffi2lua_xxx or lua2ffi_xxx functions.</li>
  </ul>
 </dd>
      
 <dt>fundamental_idx</dt><dd>Index into the module's own array of fundamental
  types (i.e., fundamental_hash), where the entries are just 32 bit hash values
  of the type name, like "signed char*" or "long unsigned int".  When a module
  is loaded, the conversion table <tt>module.fundamental_map</tt> is created
  that gives the core module's fundamental_idx, i.e. the index into the core
  module's <tt>ffi_type_map</tt>.</dd>

 <dt>is_const</dt><dd>Set if this type is a "const" type, i.e. points to an
  immutable memory area; this is only useful for pointers.</dd>

 <dt>is_native</dt><dd>If zero, this entry refers to a data type in another
  module; only the <tt>name_hash</tt> field is used in this case.  If one,
  this is a regular type entry; and if two, it's a fundamental data type and
  isn't added to <tt>gnome.typemap</tt> <i>(Note: might be changed soon as of
  2008-08-20)</i></dd>

 <dt>indirections</dt><dd>Specifies how many "*" to place after the type's
  name, for example, this is 0 for "char" and 1 for "char*". This is sometimes
  less than the corresponding fundamental type has, because the plain type name
  may already be a pointer, e.g. "GdkAtom".</dd>

 <dt>is_array</dt><dd>If set, then this type is a one- or twodimensional
  array.  This is very rare and so an extra array is used to specify the
  dimensions for such types (see <tt>struct array_info</tt> and
  <tt>module.array_list</tt>).</dd>

 <dt>name_ofs</dt><dd>Offset into the big name string where the name of this
  type is stored.  Using an offset instead of a pointer has advantages: the
  size of the offset is less than a full pointer, and no relocation needs to
  be done when the module shared object is loaded.</dd>

 <dt>for structures</dt><dd>If the fundamental type specifies a structure,
  following fields are filled: <b>struct_size, elem_start, elem_count</b>,
  which detail the structure and refer to the <tt>module.elem_list</tt>.

 <dt>for functions</dt><dd>If the fundamental type is a function, an offset
  into the function prototypes in provided.  The information contained there
  is identical to the data in the function hash table.</dd>

 <dt>for <a name="nonnative">non-native types</a></dt><dd>The hash value of the
  type's name is stored; it is used to look up the type in the table
  <tt>gnome.typemap</tt> as described in the section about <a
  href="hashtables.html#typehash">Type Hashing</a>.  Additionally, either the
  name of the module known to contain that type is given, or the type's name.
  This allows to automatically load the correct module, or to display a
  sensible error message.
