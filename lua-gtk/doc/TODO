TODO
----

- ENUM/FLAGS:
  - SUB operation on flags - set and clear the bits.

- parse-xml: override to many...

- struct_nr 0 now means unset; don't use -1 anywhere.

- call tracing should work again.  function to show an arbitrary function's
  definition (parameter types and so forth)

- fix the build process.  It is a mess, not portable enough.  waf?  autofoo?

- rework the source code for more clarity, better separation into modules,
  comments, refactor large functions.

- save some more space.

- running Win executables with wine under Linux, and using glade.lua - font
  sizes are insanely large.

- refcounting on GIOChannel not OK.  Sometimes in-use channels are freed,
  which aborts communication.

- make sure my reference counting (g_object_ref/_unref) is correct.
  seems to be ok...

- Gtk seems to be leaky...  how to minimize that?

- try LuaJIT - should speed everything up.  at least check that it works with
  it because in a larger project, somebody might want to use it.

- exporting existing GTk objects to Lua, see
