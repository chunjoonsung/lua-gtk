To Do
=====

- configuration of the languages (settings.lua); or use site languages
- variable number of languages
- upload as an example to luaforge.net

- instead of GET, POST requests should be used; after all, some requests
  can change the data on the server.  If only read-only requests are made,
  a GET could be used nevertheless.

- slow performance when loading images - where's the slowness?

- when viewing the preview, display the description.  Actually, show
  both description and title in an entry field and allow to change & save.

- retrieve the languages from the site, and use those instead of the hardcoded
  language list.
  	(OK) retrieval
	(MISSING) construct the Description page dynamically.

- when using the back/forward buttons etc., automatically select the
  corresponding icon in the icon list.

- create albums
  - ask for the name in all languages
  - create them, already linked together with a new trid.

- rename albums.

- move an image to another album - drag & drop!
  - drag into another album: put it there.  check the language.

- when loading the thumbnails, check the language of each one.  if it doesn't
  match the album's language, show a warning; if the album has a connected
  other album of the correct language, offer to move the image(s) there.
  collect all warnings together and ask just once, or once every 10 messages.

- mark multiple icons; then delete, move.

- configure
  - host, username, password
  - default image size, e.g. 1024x768
  - default startup directory
  - size of image cache
  - thumbnail cache on disk - size, location.

  - save configuration in a lua file.  parse it at startup.

- When adding an image, also add it to the album if it is currently being
  displayed?  not an issue, re-read from server.

- Thumbnail cache on disk.  The file writer could also be working in the
  background.  At startup, get a directory listing; name is by image_id
  and size code, e.g. 345t is thumbnail for image #345.  This loading should,
  of course, be asynchronous.

  This is not useful when running this app from a memory stick, which is
  rather slow, and I want as little writes as required.

- Show the average bytes/s communication with the server.

- Disallow activation of the page with the text unless an image is being
  uploaded.

- Make sure the Abort button always works.

- Only one function can use the progress bar at a time.  If it is in use,
  the second (third...) user cannot display anything.  When finished, the
  next one can then display the information.
