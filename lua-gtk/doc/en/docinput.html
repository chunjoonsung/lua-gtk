<p>
The structure of an HTML input file is just like a regular HTML file, but it
doesn't have any header, footer, menu or other boilerplate code.  Its content
is processed and then put into a "content div" block.
</p>

<p>
The special file <tt>template.html</tt> is read once, and its placeholders
replaced by content for each input file to generate the output files.  Known
placeholders are as follows:
</p>

<dl>
 <dt>#TITLE#</dt><dd>The page's title (from the menu)</dd>
 <dt>#MAINMENU#</dt><dd>The toplevel menu items in a horizontal layout</dd>
 <dt>#SIDEMENU#</dt><dd>A menu structure appropriate for the current page</dd>
 <dt>#CONTENT#</dt><dd>The actual content of the input file (after processing)
  </dd>
 <dt>#CONTENTCLASS#</dt><dd>When no side menu is present, set to
   <tt>center</tt>, else to <tt>right</tt>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The processing step mentioned above detects code blocks, replacing them by
the output of the Lua code contained therein.  This code is executed in a
limited environment providing a few functions:
</p>

<dl>
 <dt>copy_function(filename, functionname)</dt><dd>Open the given Lua file,
   and look for the given function.  The function body is extracted,
   highlighted and returned.</dd>
 <dt>inline_code(s, ...)</dt><dd>The first argument is the code to display;
   it is highlighted.  The opional additional arguments are appended to the
   code verbatim and might be used for a short explanation.</dd>
</dl>
