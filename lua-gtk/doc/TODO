----

- support for String ENUMs (for stock names)

- use gtk_tree_iter_free!  is this already so?

- wrapper for gtk_tree_model_get would be nice.

- socket_co: connect attempts must be asynchronous, otherwise the GUI can be
  blocked (by a slow DNS server, for example).

- gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new should return a GtkFileChooserDialog, not
  GtkDialog.  Is the former not included in the "used" classes? fixed,
  regenerate gtkdata.*

- add certain #defines from the Gtk includes to the ENUM list automatically.
	gdk/gdkkeysyms.h
	gdk/gdkselection.h
	gtk/gtkstock.h

- review all the code for improvements and maybe some bugs, esp. the
  segfaults when not optimized on amd64.

- mingw port:
	- test it, users report that it's broken

- amd64 port:
	- fix segfaults when compiled without -O
	- fix spurious segfaults in weather demo
	- fix segfault in window demo (close with X button)!

- exporting existing Gtk objects to Lua, see
  http://luaforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=827&forum_id=536

- check refcounting usage, memory leaks
	- valgrind
	- glib memory statistics
	- make sure my reference counting (g_object_ref/_unref) is correct.
	  seems to be ok...
	- refcounting on GIOChannel not OK.  Sometimes in-use channels are
	  freed, which aborts communication.

- more documentation
	- improve the homepage, add more content, better layout
	- use luadoc tags for all user visible functions in the C modules
	- developer documentation to give pointers for hacking

- call tracing should show the actual values of the arguments; would require
  a new callback for each parameter type, some kind of tostring.

- running Win executables with wine under Linux, and using glade.lua - font
  sizes are insanely large.

- try LuaJIT - should speed everything up.  at least check that it works with
  it because in a larger project, somebody might want to use it.
