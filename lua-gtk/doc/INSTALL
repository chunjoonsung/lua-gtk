Installation Instructions for Linux
===================================


I have not tested this much with Windows (or rather, Wine), so it is for Linux
only so far.  Tested on Debian/testing.

Requisites:

  - Gtk2 (tested with 2.6.8 and 2.8.16) with devel files
  - libffi
  - lua5
  - cmph (optional, at http://sf.net/projects/cmph)
  - gcc, binutils, make, ...


Prodecure:

 - edit Makefile.linux and/or Makefile.win32 to suit your installation.  This
   is NOT an autoconf generated file.  Not many options are useful to change.
 - run make
 - run make install

Now you should be ready to run the example scripts:

$ lua -w examples/button.lua
$ lua -w examples/pixmap.lua



Installation Instructions for MingW32
=====================================

To build this package for Win32 please use MingW32.  The resulting binaries run
on native Windows, too.  Therefore, install the mingw32 build environment, e.g.
for Debian, try "apt-get install mingw32".


Step 1
------

Build the package for Linux by typing "make".  This produces some intermediary
files that are needed by the windows build, too.



Step 2
------

Download the latest windows binaries from luaforge.net (project LuaBinaries),
and unpack so that a lua5.1 directory appears:

	lua5_1_Win32_dll.tar.gz
	lua5_1_Win32_bin.tar.gz


Step 3
------

Run the Makefile like this:

	make -f Makefile.win32

This builds the file gtk2.dll in build-win32.  You may want to "strip" the
resulting DLL to save space.

To actually use this library, follow the instructions in README.win32.txt.
