<p>
The most important part of LuaGnome is the ability to call almost any function
provided by the supported libraries.  This section explains how to do this.
</p>

<h3>Non-object-oriented calls</h3>

<p>
Using a syntax very similar to the C API, you can call a function like in
the following example:
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
require "glib"
print(glib.get_user_name())
print(glib.build_filename("one", "two", "three"))
]] %>

<p>
Note how the <code>glib</code> object is used.  It is a module that provides
the bindings to GLib, and has a prefix for functions built in, in this case
"g_".  While you could also call <code>glib.g_get_user_name()</code>, the
preferred usage is without that prefix.
</p>


<h3>Object-oriented calls (methods)</h3>

<p>
Most of the supported functions can be considered methods, with their first
argument being the object to manipulate.  The following examples demonstrate
how such methods are called:
</p>

<%= copy_file "doc/en/call1.lua" %>

<p>
When calling a method on an object, the library function to call is computed
using the object's type name and the method name.  In the example above,
from the type <code>GMatchInfo</code> and the method name
<code>get_string</code>, the computed function name is
<code>g_match_info_get_string</code>.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately most of the GLib/GDK/Gtk/... functions have consistent names,
always starting with the mangled type name and a method name.  In some cases
aliases have been defined where this pattern is not followed.
</p>

</p>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>
Refer to the official C API documentation of the library for the specification
of the argument list.  Most of the C types are supported by LuaGnome, which has
to convert Lua values to C before calling a library function.  Even multiple
indirections (pointer to pointer to something) are supported.
</p>

<p>
Simple data types like strings, numbers, but also objects are quite easy to
convert.  Other types like function pointers, boxed values, void pointers and
others are more involved and are explained in detail on separate pages.
</p>

<h3>Return values</h3>

<p>
Each function may have none, one or multiple return values.  The called C
function can have only one "real" return value, of course.  Multiple values
can, however, be returned by providing a pointer as argument, and the library
function stores additional values at this location, as in the following example:
</p>

<div class="code"><code>
// this is C code.
gchar *endptr = NULL;
gint64 val = g_ascii_stroll("123foo", &amp;endptr, 0);
// endptr now points to the "f" in the given string.
</code></div>

<p>
A one-to-one emulation of this in Lua might look like this ugly contraption:
</p>


<%= inline_code [[
require "glib"

-- this is NOT how it is done
endptr = gnome.pointer "char*"
val = glib.ascii_stroll("123foo", endptr, 0)
print(val, endptr.content)
]] %>

<p>
Instead, Lua's ability to return multiple values from functions is used.  You
only have to provide the initialization as argument, and the return values are
returned in order.  LuaGnome is fairly adept at figuring out which arguments
are used as output, and which are not.
</p>

<p>
As a special case, a double pointer argument like <code>char**</code>
or <code>GError**</code> is an output argument; that is, the called function
will place a pointer at the given location.  If you specify nil, then no
output is generated.  If you want the function to receive a valid pointer to
a location that contains NULL, and whose content is returned, you have to
use <code>gnome.NIL</code>.
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
&gt; require "glib"
&gt; print(glib.ascii_strtoll("123foo", nil, 0))
123
&gt; print(glib.ascii_strtoll("123foo", gnome.NIL, 0))
123    foo
]] %>
