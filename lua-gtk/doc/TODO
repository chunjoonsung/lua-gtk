- ENUM/FLAGS:
  - SUB operation on flags - set and clear the bits.

- parse-xml: override to many...

- struct_nr 0 now means unset; don't use -1 anywhere.

- 64 bit port:
	- working examples: gladedemo gladedemo2 iconview toolbar tree window notebook
	  button combobox memory loadlib calculator
	- working tests: 001 002 003
	- pixmap segfaults
	- request: luasocket not installed

- call tracing should show the actual values of the arguments; would require
  a new callback for each parameter type, some kind of tostring.

- fix the build process.  It is a mess, not portable enough.  waf?  autofoo?

- running Win executables with wine under Linux, and using glade.lua - font
  sizes are insanely large.

- refcounting on GIOChannel not OK.  Sometimes in-use channels are freed,
  which aborts communication.

- make sure my reference counting (g_object_ref/_unref) is correct.
  seems to be ok...

- Gtk seems to be leaky...  how to minimize that?

- try LuaJIT - should speed everything up.  at least check that it works with
  it because in a larger project, somebody might want to use it.

- exporting existing GTk objects to Lua, see
