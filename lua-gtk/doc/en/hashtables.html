<p>
Within LuaGnome hash values and hash tables are used extensively to reduce
memory footprint and increase performance.  One area is to lookup a function's
signature given its name, another to get a constant's value.  Finally, hash
values are used to refer to types defined in other modules.
</p>

<h4>Functions and Constants</h4>

<p>
Functions and constants are stored in hash tables, with the key being
the name of the symbol and the data the function signature or the
<a href="#constants">constant's value</a>, respectively.
</p>

<p>
For these hash tables either a simple algorithm is used that has no external
build-time dependencies, or the excellent <b>cmph</b> library that generates
minimal perfect hash tables.  There are no runtime dependencies, as the hash
lookup code is simple in either case and is included in LuaGnome's sources.
</p>

<p>
Note that in both cases the actual keys (strings) are not stored anywhere.
Only the strings' hash values are represented.  The hashing algorithm
guarantees (by storing and comparing the 32 bit hash value) that unknown keys
are not found.
</p>


<a name="typehash"><h4>Type Hashing</h4></a>

<p>
The second group of hashing concerns the resolution of data types which are
defined in another module.  A modules wrapping one library, like gdk or gtk,
may need to use data types provided by other libraries, like glib.  A data type
is therefore "native" in only one module and "non-native" in all others.  This
helps to keep the modules small and avoid code duplication.
</p>

<p>
Such "non-native" data types have to be looked up somehow when used.  The first
implementation simply stored each non-native type's name, which would be
searched for in other loaded modules on the first access.  Unfortunately this
duplicates lots of type names.  To make this more efficient, only a 32 bit hash
value is stored instead of the name.
</p>

<p>
When a module is loaded, it is assigned the next available module index.  The
names of all its data types are processed by a hash function, and entries are
added to <tt>gnome.typemap</tt>.  Each entry has this logical content:
</p>

<img src="img/architecture1.png" alt="Typemap Entry" />

<p>
For example, the function <tt>gtk_widget_get_type()</tt> in gtk returns a
GType, which is handled in glib.  The function's prototype lists the type
number in the module's own type list; this may require one or two bytes.  The
entry for GType in gtk specifies a "non-native" type and a 32 bit hash value
(<a href="datatypes.html#nonnative">more detail</a>).
</p>

<p>
This hash value is looked up in <tt>gnome.typemap</tt>.  The corresponding
entry was created when glib was loaded, so that yields glib's module index
(dynamically assigned during loading) and the type number in this module's type
array.
</p>

<p>
It is perfectly possible that the lookup in <tt>gnome.typemap</tt> fails, when
the module handling that type is not loaded; e.g. if you call
<tt>win.window:cairo_create()</tt> without having loaded the module cairo, the
return type "cairo*" is not known.  In this case, the following error message
is shown:
</p>

<p><code>
[gtk] using unresolved type gdk.66
stack traceback:
	[C]: in function 'cairo_create'
	...
</code></p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this message is not very helpful; it doesn't read "you need
to load the cairo module", neither is that module loaded automatically.  The
hash value doesn't indicate which module handles it.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, fundamental data types are looked up by the hash value of their name
in <tt>gnome.fundamental_map</tt> (see below).
</p>
