<p>
Select a location from the dropdown to display the current weather forecast.
The program is available in the CVS repository.
</p>

<img class="screenshot" width=591 height=379 src="img/weather1.png"
 alt="Weather Update screenshot" />

<p>
The required libraries in this case are:
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
require "gtk"
require "gtk.http_co"
require "lxp"
require "gtk.strict"]]
%>

<p>
"lxp" is LuaExpat, the binding to the expat xml parser.  The following function
is the handler for changes in the dropdown and starts an asynchronous
HTTP request to fetch the weather info.  The "_co" suffix indicates that
a coroutine is used.
</p>

<div class="code"><code>
<%= copy_function("../weather/weather.lua", "on_location_changed") %>
</code></div>

<p>
The total code size of this example is about 270 lines, most of it concerned
with parsing the response and building the GUI elements to show it.
