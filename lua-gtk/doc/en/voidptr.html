<p>
Many library functions accept an opaque "void*" argument which is passed
as-is to a callback also provided by the user.  For example, you could
do the following (from examples/clock.lua):
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
  lbl = gtk.label_new ""
  onTimeoutClosure = gnome.closure(onTimeout)
  timer = glib.timeout_add(1000, onTimeoutClosure, lbl)
]] %>

<p>
In this case, an object (GtkLabel) is given for the void* argument.  This needs
no special handling, but you must make sure that the object is not freed, so
the following code, appended to the one above, leads to problems:
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
  lbl = nil
  collectgarbage "collect"
]] %>

<p>
Following Lua types can be converted to a void* argument by the function
lua2ffi_void_ptr (in src/voidptr.c):
</p>

<ul>
 <li>nil: easy, a NULL pointer is used. </li>
 <li>lightuserdata: it is used as pointer.  This isn't actually used, but it's
   easy to implement, so it's there. </li>
 <li>an object, like GtkLabel in the example above: the pointer to the Gtk
   object is used. </li>
 <li>other userdata: can be a constant (enum), a void* wrapper, a boxed value,
   or some arbitrary userdata (a warning is printed).  </li>
 <li>arbitrary Lua value: must be wrapped, see below. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Void* Wrapper</h3>

<p>
As mentioned in the list above, a "void* wrapper" exists to handle arbitrary
Lua values.  The library must be given a void* pointer which must
continue to be valid while it is used, and should be freed afterwards.
When accessing such a void*, for example as an argument to a callback, or
as an element of a structure, it must be possible to retrieve its value
or free the value.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, a void* wrapper consists of three interdependent entities:
</p>

<table><tr><td>

<img src="img/voidptr1.png" alt="Structure Diagram" />

</td><td>

<ol>
 <li>Zero or more Lua userdatas (Lua Wrappers) with a pointer to the C
   structure.  This is what the programs "see" and work with.  It has
   a metatable to allow several methods of accessing the data.</li>
 <li>A C structure (the void* wrapper) with a reference to the Lua value and a
   reference counter, which counts how many Lua Wrappers exist for it.  This
   counter should be at least one, and is updated when Lua Wrappers are created
   and garbage collected.  When it drops to zero, the void* wrapper is
   automatically freed.</li>
 <li>An arbitrary Lua value, like a string, a table etc.  A reference is
   created through the luaL_ref mechanism and stored in the void* wrapper.</li>
</ol>

</td></tr></table>

<p>
For example, a "GTree" (of GLib) stores pairs of void* (key and value).  A
complete example can be found in <tt>tests/027-closure.lua</tt>.  The important
parts of this example are given below:
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
function destroy_it(wrapper)
    wrapper:destroy()
end

cl = { gnome.closure(compare_func), gnome.closure(destroy_it) }
t = glib.tree_new_full(cl[1], nil, cl[2], cl[2])
t._closures = cl
cl = nil

t:insert("hello", "world")
t:insert("another key", { 2, 3, 4, "another value" })

t:destroy()

]] %>

<p>
When you remove an item, or call :destroy on the tree (which removes all
items), the "destroy_it" function is called for both key and value; it
receives a Lua representation of the wrapper and not the wrapped object.  This
allows to call the destroy method on it, or use its value.  This Lua userdata
forwards __len, __index and __newindex to the wrapped Lua value, which is
useful if it's a table, for example.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note</b> When you need to pass a Lua value to a function that expects
a GValue, like gtk_tree_model_set_value, you need to use a
<a href="boxed.html">Boxed Value</a>.
</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<h4>gnome.void_ptr(value)</h4>

<p>Create a void* wrapper for the given value, and return a Lua object
representing it.  The wrapper's reference counter is set to one, so that when 
the Lua object is freed, the void* wrapper is also released.</p>

<h4>any_function(value)</h4>

<p>If the argument type of <tt>value</tt> is "void*" (or simliar, like
gpointer), and <tt>value</tt> is not already a void* wrapper, then a void*
wrapper is automatically created for it.  Its reference counter is also set to
one, but no Lua object is created.  So it will not be freed automatically, but
you have to do that manually by calling the :destroy() method on the void*
wrapper.
</p>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p>
As you can see, memory management is not automatic for void* wrappers.
Lua-Gnome can't infer automatically when such a void* wrapper is not needed
anymore, unless specialized handlers are written for individual classes.
To aid finding memory leaks, two functions are provided:
</p>

<h4>gnome.get_vwrappers_count()</h4>

<p>Returns three integers: the number of currently existing void* wrappers, how
many were allocated in total (can be less than the first number if some have
already been freed), and finally the number of currently existing Lua
representations of void* wrappers; this is only for information as these are
garbage collected automatically by Lua.
</p>

<h4>gnome.dump_vwrappers()</h4>

<p>Show the information of the above function, and show a list of currently
existing void* wrappers; each with memory address, followed by the source file
and line number where it was allocated.
</p>
