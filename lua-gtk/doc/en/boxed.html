<p>
It is sometimes useful to pass an arbitrary Lua value to a library function,
which then stores it and can return it later.  GObject provides the type
<a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/stable/gobject-Boxed-Types.html">GBoxed</a>,
which is a generic wrapper for arbitrary C structures.  LuaGnome defines a new
boxed type that has a reference to a Lua type, and can therefore store one
Lua value each.
</p>

<p>
This is useful for example to store a table in one column of a GtkTreeStore,
most likely in column 0.  This is an example how to do it:
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
store = gtk.list_store_new(2, gnome.boxed_type, glib.TYPE_STRING)
iter = gtk.new "TreeIter"
row1 = { id=5, name="Row One", value=20 }
row2 = { id=6, name="Row Two", value=25, _type="boxed" }

store:insert_with_values(nil, 0,
   0, gnome.box(row),
   1, row.name,
   -1)

store:insert_with_values(iter, 0,
   0, row2,
   1, row2.name,
   -1)
]] %>

<p>
In this example, a GtkListStore is created with two columns: one to hold a
boxed type, another with a string.  Two variants are shown how to tell LuaGnome
that the vararg argument should be a boxed value: either you call the function
<tt>gnome.box</tt>, or you provide a table that has the field _type set to
"boxed".
</p>

<p>
Note that the column type must be <i>gnome.boxed_type</i>, which is not
available when you create the GtkListStore or GtkTreeStore in Glade.
Unfortunately you have to create the store in your code as shown above.
</p>

<p>
To access these values again, do the following:
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
row = store:get_value(iter, 0)
print(row.name)
]] %>

<p>
When a function returns a GValue that contains such a boxed value, it is
automatically "extracted" and the wrapped value is returned.  See
src/gnome/gvalue.c:lg_lua_to_gvalue().
</p>

<p>
When you have a boxed value, e.g. created by <tt>gnome.box</tt>, you can
still access its fields directly (assuming that it is a table or something
with an appropriate metatable).  There is one exception: when you access
the field "value" (only for reading), the wrapped Lua value is returned
instead.
</p>


<%= inline_code [[
val = gnome.box { a=10, b=20, c=30 }
assert(val.a == 10)
assert(val.b == 20)
assert(val.value.c == 30)
val.d = 40
assert(val.d == 40)
]] %>

<h3>Type Casting</h3>

<p>
When you box a value, and then access it (or a library accesses it), the type
of the value is determined automatically from the Lua type.  In some cases
this automatic detection doesn't work, for example if you provide an integer,
but the library expects a double.
</p>

<p>
In this case, provide a second argument to the function <tt>gnome.box</tt>,
specifying the desired type.  Example:
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
glib.printf("%f\n", gnome.box(20, "double"))
]] %>

<h3>Function reference</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>gnome.box(value [, type])</dt><dd>Explicitely create a boxed value of
  the given Lua value, and return the GBoxed value.  </dd>
</dl>
