<p>
These are the installation instructions for LuaGnome.  It is distributed
primarily as source tarball, with precompiled binaries possibly available
for Linux (different architectures), Windows, and as Debian packages (most
likely not the latest versions).  You can also get the latest source from
the CVS repository on LuaForge.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>
The following software is required to build LuaGnome:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>Lua 5.1 with some libraries: lfs, bit, lxp</li>
 <li>gcc</li>
 <li>make</li>
 <li>gccxml</li>
 <li>ffi (foreign function interface)</li>
 <li>(optional) <a href="http://cmph.sf.net/">cmph</a></li>
 <li>The libraries to support, i.e. glib, gdk, gtk, atk, cairo etc., with
   their header files.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Fetch the source from either CVS or as source tarball, unpack.</li>
 <li>Run the script <tt>./configure</tt> (which is a Lua script, not
  autoconf)</li>
 <li>Run <tt>make</tt></li>
 <li>Run <tt>make install</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>
On success, you can now run the included tests, examples or other programs.
If something didn't work, please use your skillz to fix it, otherwise write
about your problems on the project's forums on LuaForge.
</p>

<h3>About CMPH</h3>

<p>
This is a library to create and use minimal perfect hash (mph) tables.
LuaGnome relies heavily on hashing to look up functions, constants, types and
fundamental types.  Thus having a good hashing algorithm and functions
available improves execution speed and reduces memory usage.  All these tables
are computed at build time, saved as .c files which are then compiled into the
modules.
</p>

<p>
Note: a hash <i>function</i> computes a hash value for a given input string.  A
hash <i>algorithm</i> maps an input string to a bucket number, and requires at
least one hash function.
</p>

<p>
Cmph comes with various algorithms.  Two of them are currently supported by
LuaGnome, which doesn't link with the cmph library, but implements the (simple)
lookup functions directly to save space (and because cmph doesn't offer saving
a hash table to a .c file).
</p>

<ul>
 <li>The older <b>fch</b> algorithm already delivers excellent results.</li>
 <li>The newer <b>bdz</b> algorithm, available starting with cmph version 0.8,
   results in slightly smaller hash table data which is generated a lot
   faster. </li>
 <li>A fallback algorithm (named <b>simple</b>) is not part of cmph.  It
   produces somewhat larger data tables and probably runs somewhat slower at
   runtime, but doesn't require cmph to build.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For comparison, the complete build of LuaGnome on Linux/i386 with all 10
libaries supported as of 12/2008 results in the following combined binary
sizes:
</p>

<table>
 <tr><th>Algorithm</th><th>Size in kB</th></tr>
 <tr><td>simple</td><td>415</td></tr>
 <tr><td>fch</td><td>372</td></tr>
 <tr><td>bdz</td><td>370</td></tr>
</table>
