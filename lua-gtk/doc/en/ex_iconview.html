<p>
A simple demo with a <code>GtkIconView</code> widget filled with a few
stock icons.
</p>

<img class="screenshot" width=210 height=275 src="img/iconview.png"
  alt="IconView screenshot" />

<p>
The code to obtain this (without Glade) is quite straightforward.  Create a
window, within it a scrolled window, and within that a GtkIconView.  A list
store is attached to it and filled with a few icons.
</p>

<div class="code"><code>
<%= copy_function("examples/iconview.lua", "MainWin.new") %>
</code></div>
