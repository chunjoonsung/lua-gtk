<h2>What is LuaGnome?</h2>

<p>
LuaGnome provides a fairly complete binding to Gnome Libraries Lua, including
glib 2.x, gdk, gtk 2.x, and a list of supporting libraries.
</p>

<p>
With it, you can write small or large applications only in Lua, while using Gtk
through an API that almost matches the C API.  Currently about 7600 functions
and 700 structures, unions, as well as about 5800 constants (enums, #defines)
are available.  Still, the library is just about 350 kB when compiled (plus a
few small, optional Lua files).
</p>

<p>
For interface design, I recommend <a
href="http://glade.gnome.org/">glade-3</a>.  The XML files generated by it can
be read by the <code>GtkBuilder</code> class.  Previous versions of Glade used
an older file format with the extension .glade, these files had to converted
by the <code>gtk-builder-convert</code> script.
</p>

<p>
A supporting Lua library makes it easy to do <b>asynchronous network
communication</b>, i.e. in the background, without blocking the GUI.
Currently, HTTP and FTP protocols are implemented.  Some sample applications
are provided.
</p>


<h3>Platforms</h3>

<p>
The primary platform is Linux.  It can be cross-compiled for
Windows using <a href="http://mingw.org/">MinGW</a>.
Scripts can (with some care) run on these platforms without changes.
A <b>Debian package</b> is available, currently in testing:
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/lenny/liblua5.1-gtk-0">package page</a>.
</p>

<p>
The library is available under the same terms and conditions as the Lua
language, the MIT license, and the LGPL (Lesser GNU Public License). The idea
is that if you can use Lua (and Gtk) in a project, you should also be able to
use LuaGnome.
