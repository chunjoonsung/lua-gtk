<p>
This is a list of at least some messages that LuaGnome can emit, along with
hints of what the problem is, how to correct it and the location in the source
where this message is emitted.
</p>

<p>
Note that the message name is in the form [LG {modulename}.{id}], which was
chosen to be easily and uniquely searchable on the Internet, and must be
identical in any translations (which may be available in the future).
</p>

<p>
Messages in the source files are in English; they can be translated at
runtime into any other language if a suitable translation is available.
Anyone can participate in translating at the website
<a href="http://luagnome.oertl.at/">luagnome.oertl.at</a> (<i>planned</i>).
