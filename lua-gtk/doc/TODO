TODO
----

- fix the Win32 build process

- fix the cairo related errors in script/gen-list.pl

- rework the source code for more clarity, better separation into modules,
  comments, refactor large functions.

- save some more space.
	- src/luagtk.h
		- struct_info: maybe remove struct_size, see struct_elem
			Saves about 1 kB
		- struct name string: remove \000 separators?  Length is
		  defined by next struct_list entry.  Saves about 450 Byte,
		  but probably adds some code.

- running Win executables with wine under Linux, and using glade.lua - font
  sizes are insanely large.

- refcounting on GIOChannel not OK.  Sometimes in-use channels are freed,
  which aborts communication.

- maybe use the perfect hash function mph-1.2 instead of my own.

- make sure my reference counting (g_object_ref/_unref) is correct.
  seems to be ok...

- Gtk seems to be leaky...  how to minimize that?

	gtk_tree_path_new_from_string allocates something. what it
	returns must be freed eventually.

- try LuaJIT - should speed everything up.  at least check that it works with
  it because in a larger project, somebody might want to use it.
