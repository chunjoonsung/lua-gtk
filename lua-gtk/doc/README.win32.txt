
Lua-Gtk2
========

  I assume that you have downloaded the windows binary package for lua-gtk2.
Unless you already have Gtk+2, download and run the newest version named
gtk+-2.x.x-setup.exe [1].  Optionally get the current Lua binary and library
[2], but the required files are already included in this package.

  Now you can run "lua5.1 examples/button.lua".  Try the other examples.  More
are available in the CVS repository on luaforge:

	http://luaforge.net/plugins/scmcvs/cvsweb.php/?cvsroot=lua-gtk
	http://luaforge.net/snapshots.php?group_id=121

  You probably want to refer to the documentation about GTK [3], and also the
source package for lua-gtk2 [4] for additional information (license, some
documentation etc.).

Cheers,
Wolfgang Oertl
