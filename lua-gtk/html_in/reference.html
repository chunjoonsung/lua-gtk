<h2>Reference</h2>

<p>
This reference is generated from the documentation embedded in the source
code.  Note that the gtk_internal modules document functions that are not
available to a library user, but describe internals of the library.  As such,
they are interesting to programmers wishing to hack on lua-gtk.
</p>

<p>
This reference is a work in progress and not yet complete.  I am still working
on it.

<h2>Additional documentatiaon</h2>

<p>
I am trying to document some important points on using lua-gtk, where it
is not obvious and may differ somewhat from using Gtk directly.
