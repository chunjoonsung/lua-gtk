<h2>What is Lua-Gtk?</h2>

<p>
Lua-Gtk provides a complete binding to Gtk 2.x for Lua.  With it, you can
write small or large applications only in Lua, while using Gtk through an
API that almost matches the C API.  All of the over 5500 functions and
700 structures, unions and enums are available.  Still, the library is just
about 200 kB when compiled (plus a few small Lua files).
</p>

<p>
For interface design, I recommend <a href="...">glade-3</a>.  The XML files
generated by it can be used by the <code>glade.lua</code> module or (since
Gtk 2.12.0) be read by the <code>GtkBuilder</code> class after a conversion
by the <code>gtk-builder-convert</code> script.
</p>

<p>
A supporting Lua library makes it easy to do <b>asynchronous network
communication</b>, i.e. in the background, without blocking the GUI.
Currently, HTTP and FTP protocols are implemented.  Some sample applications
are provided.
</p>

<p>
The primary <b>platform</b> is Linux, even though it should also compile for
Windows (via MinGW).  I'm currently (Nov. 07) unable to build it due to
problems with the mingw package on Debian.
</p>

<p>
The library is available under the same terms and conditions as the Lua
language, the MIT license. The idea is that if you can use Lua in a project,
you should also be able to use Lua-Gtk.
