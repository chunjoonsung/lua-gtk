TODO
----

- review all the code for improvements and maybe some bugs

- use gtk_tree_iter_free!  is this already so?

- wrapper for gtk_tree_model_get would be nice.

- socket_co: connect attempts must be asynchronous, otherwise the GUI can be
  blocked (by a slow DNS server, for example).

- add more #defines from the Gtk includes to the ENUM list automatically.
	gdk/gdkkeysyms.h
	gdk/gdkselection.h

- mingw port:
	- test it, users report that it's broken

- exporting existing Gtk objects to Lua, see
  http://luaforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=827&forum_id=536

- check refcounting usage, memory leaks
	- valgrind
	- glib memory statistics
	- make sure my reference counting (g_object_ref/_unref) is correct.
	  seems to be ok...
	- refcounting on GIOChannel not OK.  Sometimes in-use channels are
	  freed, which aborts communication.

- more documentation
	- improve the homepage, add more content, better layout
	- use luadoc tags for all user visible functions in the C modules
	- developer documentation to give pointers for hacking

- call tracing should show the actual values of the arguments; would require
  a new callback for each parameter type, some kind of tostring.

- running Win executables with wine under Linux, and using glade.lua - font
  sizes are insanely large.

- try LuaJIT - should speed everything up.  at least check that it works with
  it because in a larger project, somebody might want to use it.
