<p>
From version 0.9 to version 1.0, lua-gtk has been split up into multiple
modules, each providing the bindings to one library.  This much more flexible
design makes it easier to add any number of library bindings, as only the
bindings you <tt>require</tt> are loaded:
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
 require "gtk"
 require "gtkhtml"
]] %>

<p>
If one binding depends on another, it is loaded automatically, as is the base
library <tt>gnome</tt>.  For example, <tt>gtk</tt> requires <tt>gdk</tt>, which
in turn depends on <tt>glib</tt>.  Therefore it is enough to <tt>require
"gtk"</tt> to get all these modules.
</p>

<p>
Now there are multiple global variables in addition to "gtk".  Each instance of
gtk in your code may now have to be replaced by one of the other variables.
While this sounds complicated, it's actually quite straightforward.  Most of
the code calls methods on objects, and this doesn't change at all.
</p>

<p>
For <b>constants</b> (enums etc.), a prefix is automatically prepended
depending on the library, so for example GTK_ for gtk, G_ for glib etc.  Remove
the prefix for cleaner code, even though you could leave it.  Some examples:
</p>

<table>
 <tr><th>Old</th><th>New</th></tr>
 <tr><td>gtk.G_TYPE_STRING</td><td>glib.TYPE_STRING</td></tr>
 <tr><td>gtk.GTK_WINDOW_TOPLEVEL</td><td>gtk.WINDOW_TOPLEVEL</td></tr>
 <tr><td>gtk.PANGO_STYLE_BOLD</td><td>pango.STYLE_BOLD</td></tr>
 <tr><td>gtk.CAIRO_FORMAT_RGB24</td><td>cairo.FORMAT_RGB24</td></tr>
</table>


<p>
Non-gtk <b>functions</b> that were previously called with a prefix are now in
the respective module's table without their prefix, even though the prefix can
be given.  This also applies to type names supplied to "new".
</p>

<table>
 <tr><th>Old</th><th>New</th></tr>
 <tr><td>gtk.g_tree_new</td><td>glib.tree_new</td></tr>
 <tr><td>gtk.html_document_new</td><td>gtkhtml.document_new</td></tr>
 <tr><td>gtk.gdk_pixbuf_get_type()</td><td>gdk.pixbuf_get_type()</td></tr>
 <tr><td>gtk.new "GtkTreeIter"</td><td>gtk.new "TreeIter"</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The LuaGnome specific functions are now in <tt>gnome</tt> and have sometimes
simpler names, because no collision with module functions can happen
anymore.
</p>

<table>
 <tr><th>Old</th><th>New</th></tr>
 <tr><td>gtk.make_boxed_value(x)</td><td>gnome.box(x)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>gtk.get_boxed_value(x)</td><td>x.value</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Some overrides have been removed, so that the LuaGnome API resembles the C API
more closely.  This reduces the additional knowledge required to code for
LuaGnome.
</p>

<table>
 <tr><th>old</th><th>New</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
 <tr>
   <td><%= inline_code [[treestore:append1(iter, parent, val1, val2)]] %></td>
   <td><%= inline_code [[
iter = gtk.new "TreeIter"
treestore:append(iter, parent)
treestore:set(iter, 0, val1, 1, val2, -1)]] %>
</table>
