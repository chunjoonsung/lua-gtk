<p>
The menus can be nested to multiple levels; each menu is therefore a list
of entries with filename, page title and an optional submenu.  It is defined by
the input file <code>menu.lua</code>, which must define one variable named
<code>menu</code> following this schema:
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
menu = { item, ... }
item = { "filename", "Title" [, menu] }
]] %>

<p>
Here is an example with just two levels for simplicity.  Note that for each
page being generated, a static menu is produced with the current menu item
in bold, with the "surrounding" menu items being displayed as links.
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
menu = {
    { "index", "Home" },
    { "first", "First Toplevel Page" },
    { "second", "Second Toplevel Page", {
        { "third", "Subpage of Second" },
        { "fourth", "Another Subpage" },
    } },
}
]] %>
