TODO
----

- review all the code for improvements and maybe some bugs, esp. the
  segfaults when not optimized on amd64.
	- struct_nr 0 now means unset; don't use -1 anywhere.

- amd64 port:
	- fix segfaults when compiled without -O
	- fix spurious segfaults in weather demo

- widget aliases:
	- check refcounting usage
	- unref an alias - not collected by garbage collection?

- modularize channel.c so that it contains everything related to channels.
  This should make it easier to add more modules later.

- more documentation
	- homepage with documentation on luaforge.net
	- how to generate it?  any lua based systems? cgilua?

- use luadoc to generate some documentation.  A taglet is required for
  parsing C instead of Lua.

- call tracing should show the actual values of the arguments; would require
  a new callback for each parameter type, some kind of tostring.

- running Win executables with wine under Linux, and using glade.lua - font
  sizes are insanely large.

- refcounting on GIOChannel not OK.  Sometimes in-use channels are freed,
  which aborts communication.

- make sure my reference counting (g_object_ref/_unref) is correct.
  seems to be ok...

- Gtk seems to be leaky...  how to minimize that?

- try LuaJIT - should speed everything up.  at least check that it works with
  it because in a larger project, somebody might want to use it.

- exporting existing GTk objects to Lua, see
