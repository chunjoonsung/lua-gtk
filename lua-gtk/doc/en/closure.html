<h3>Technical Background</h3>

<p>
A closure is, simply put, a prepared function call.  It therefore
specifies which function to call as well as some of the arguments to call
it with.
</p>

<p>
More specifically, a closure in this context is a function directly callable
from C, i.e. from a library, which in turn calls a Lua function that you
provide. For example, <tt>g_tree_foreach</tt> expects a <tt>GTraverseFunc</tt>,
which it calls for each node in the list.
</p>

<p>
LuaGnome can create such a closure automatically or explicitely, and you must
use the correct of these two mechanisms in order to avoid problems.  Such
a closure prepares the call to your Lua function, calls it, and returns its
return value (if any) to the closure's caller.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Another mechanism that allows a library to call a Lua function
is to install signal handlers.  This is handled by the connect function and
does not use the closures described here.
</p>



<h3>Automatic Closures</h3>

<p>
Such closures are create automatically, i.e. you provide a Lua function as
an argument to a library function.  The closure is created, used as the
argument, and dereferenced after the library function returns.  A simple
example is this:
</p>

<%= inline_code [[sel = tree_view:get_selection()
sel:selected_foreach(function(model, path, iter, data)
    print(model:get_value(iter, 0))
end, nil)]] %>

<p>
In the above code snippet, the <tt>gtk_tree_selection_selected_foreach</tt>
function calls the given function once for each selected row.
Before LuaGnome calls the <tt>..._foreach</tt> function, a closure is
created for the given function, and after the call returns, it is
dereferenced and will eventually be garbage collected.
</p>

<h3>Explicit Closures</h3>

<p>
If the function can be called later, the closure must not be freed.  To
ensure that, you have to create a closure manually, store it in a variable,
and not unset the variable until the closure is no longer needed.
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
function compare_func(a, b)
    a = a.value
    b = b.value
    if a == b then return 0 end
    return a &lt; b and -1 or 1
end

-- WRONG
t = glib.tree_new(compare_func)

-- CORRECT
compare_func_closure = gnome.closure(compare_func)
t = glib.tree_new(compare_func_closure)
]] %>

<p>
As you can see, a g_tree requires a comparison function, to order all nodes.
It will call this function (at least) every time you insert more data.
Therefore, it won't do to provide a Lua function, because the closure
created for it will be freed (or could, as soon as garbage collection runs)
too soon.  To keep such closures around, you could store them in the
object itself:
</p>

<%= inline_code [[
local closure = gnome.closure(compare_func)
t = glib.tree_new(closure)
t._compare_closure = closure
]] %>

<p>
This way, you won't have to worry about keeping the closure variable
around.  <b>Note:</b> unless you configured LuaGnome with --disable-debug,
it tries hard to detect cases when an automatic closure is given but won't
work.  You'll receive a runtime error.  Explicit closures are always safe
to use but require more coding.
