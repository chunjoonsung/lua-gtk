Weather Update
==============

This simple program retrieves weather information for locations selected
from a list.  This list is currently to be configured manually by editing
the weather.cfg file.  Later, this might be configurable through the GUI.

Currently, only weather data from accuweather.com is supported properly.
weather.com used to work, but as their terms of service are now
prohibitive, this is deprecated.




Possible data sources
---------------------

weather.com
	1.5.2008: weather.com is requesting their icons be used, ads with links
	as provided to be displayed and being sued unless their conditions are
	met.  I am now looking for an alternative data source.
